\item 5.4 Uphill - downhill Dijkstra problem

Note: HW 4.4 claimed and concluded that we can solve the single-source min cost problem for a DAG in linear time. Denote this algorithm as $DAG_{min}$. 

Divide the graph described in HW5.4 $G$ into two subgraphs, $G_{uphill}$ and $G_{downhill}$ ($G_{uphill}$ contains only uphill edges and $G_{downhill}$ contains only downhill edges). Given the fact that $v.elevation$ is different for all vertices in $G$, claim that $G_{uphill}$ and $G_{downhill}$ are both DAG. This is easy to see because cycles are not possible. Take $G_{uphill}$ for example: a cycles requires an edge from $v$ to $u$ such that there is a path from $u$ to $v$. Since we are only taking uphill edges, $u.elevation < v.elevation$. Then the edge $vu$ would be downhill, which contradicts with the uphill graph. Thus DAG is proved. The same is true for $G_{downhill}$. Then solve the single source two subgraphs $G_{downhill}$ with source $s$ and $G^T_{uphill}$ (transpose) with source $t$. The rest of the algorithm follows the Dijkstra time method.(search the two arrays generated by the two graphs and then choose the min cost. This cost $O|V|$). The DAG part should be solved in linear $O(|V|+|E|)$ as the Note claims. So the overall run time would be $O(|V|+|E|)$.
